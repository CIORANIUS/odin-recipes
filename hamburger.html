    <h1>HAMBURGUER PREPARATION METHOD</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Mixture:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>n a large bowl, combine ground beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio is ideal for juicy burgers) with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings or ingredients you prefer (e.g., garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, or finely chopped onions).
                </li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Form the Patties:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Divide the meat mixture into equal portions, typically around 4-6 ounces each.</li>
                <li>Gently shape each portion into a patty, making sure not to compress the meat too much. This keeps the burgers tender.</li>
                <li>Use your thumb to create a small indent in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.
                </li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Patties:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates or the skillet.
                </li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula, as this squeezes out the juices.</li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Toast the Buns:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.
                </li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the Hamburgers:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Place a cooked patty on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
                <li>Add your choice of cheese (cheddar, American, Swiss, etc.) if desired, letting it melt over the patty.</li>
                <li>Top with desired condiments and toppings such as lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, onions, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.</li>
                <li>Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve:
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Serve the hamburgers immediately while hot, accompanied by your favorite sides like fries, chips, or a salad.</li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
